When adding monthly budget:
1. add each expense to the DB;
2. Get the full Money amount of the expenses Added ;
3. subtract the Expenses from the Monthly Budget;
4. Add new Monthly Budget to DB;

This works , but I think it can be upgraded , I have to make sure the Fixed Expenses are always working properly or if I have to make more validations.
